## Planning for success
- Once a *business opportunity* has been identified, a number of areas need further investigation before the business opportunity becomes a reality:
	- *market research* involves collecting and analysing information about customers and the business opportunities available.
	- *location* where to locate a business is crucial because it will have  an impact on profits.

## Key features of organisational structures
- There are five main types of privately owned business entities:
	- *sole trader*
	- *partnership*
	- *private company*
	- *public company*
	- *incorporated association*
- These can be divided into:
	- *unincorporated business entities*, in the case of sole traders and partnerships	
	- *incorporated business entities*, in the case of private companies, public companies and incorporated associataions.
> The term **incorporated** refers to the process companies go through to become a seperate legal entity from the owner/s.
- An *unincorporated* business has no seperate legal existence from its owner(s) and will either be a  sole trader or a partnership. This means the business entity and the owner are one and the same. When the owner dies then so too does the business entity.
- A *sole trader* is a business that is owned and operated by one person.
- A *partnership*  is a business usually owned and operated by between two and twenty people.
- A *private company* usually has between two and 50 private owners called shareholders. Often, they are family-owned. A private company must have the words 'Proprietary Limited', abbreviated to *Pty Ltd*. The main advantage of a private company is that it's shareholders have **limited liability**, meaning if the business cannot pay its debts, a shareholder generally only loses the money she has invested in the business.
- A *public company* can have an unlimted number of shareholders. The shareholders for public companies are listed on the ASX, and the general public may buy and sell shares in those companies. A public company must have the word *Ltd* after their name.
- An *incorporated association* is a group of five or more people registered with *NSW Fair Trading*. Incorporated association are small-scale, non-profit and non-commercial in nature. They can only conduct business in the state they are registered. It has its own legal identity compared to its members. Small community groups such as sports clubs and art groups usually choose to register as incorporated associations. The incorporated association structure can be more effective for these types of organisations as they are generally simpler and more affordable than a company structure.

## Financing a business
- Finance can from a variety of sources. However, two main types of sources are available to a business. 
- The business owner can contribute their own funds *(equity)*, or they can obtain a loan from external sources *(debt)*.
- The main advantage of *debt financing* is that the owner does not have to sell any ownership in the busineses to raise funds. Also, debt  financing has certain *taxation* benefits.
- Equity has an advantage over debt because it does not have to be repaid unless the owners leave the business. It is also cheaper than debt finance because there is no interest.
- A loan may be *secured* or *unsecured*.

> A **secured loan** is where the borrower offers an asset as security, such as a car or a house, for the loan. If they do not repay the loan, the lender may sell that asset to get their money back. Secured loans offer a low interest rate but run the risk that the lender may have the right to sell the security if the borrower cannot pay.

> An **unsecured loan** is where the borrower does not need to have an asset to offer as security, but the interest rate is usually higher.

- A *prospectus* must contain all the information that investors and their professional advisors would reasonably require to make an informed decision aobout the following:
