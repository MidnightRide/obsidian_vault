# Consumer and Financial Decisions
## The Nature of Commerce
> A **consumer** is someone who purchases *goods* and *services* to satisfy their *needs* and *wants*. 

- **Goods** are things that are produced and can be physically touched; for example, a television or a car.
- **Services** are things that one person will do for someone in return for payment.
- A *consumer* has the choice of purchasing either **durable** or **non-durable** goods. A durable good is one that can be used many times, such as a car or a television. **Non-durable** goods are those that can be used only once, such as food or petrol.
- What an *individual* gives up in order to satisfy a need or a want is known as an **opportunity cost**. 
- To satisfy our *needs* and *wants*, producers use **resources** to manafacture the goods and services that we desire. The four types of resources are:
	- *land - these resources occur naturally, such as forests, coal and fertile soil.*
	- *labour - this includes both the phsycal and mental effort of people who are working.*
	- *capital - these resources are goods used to make other goods. For example, a tractor is a capital good because it is used to produce crops.*
	- *enterprise - this is the ability to combine the other resources of land, labour and capital so as to earn a profit*.
- These *resources* are limited or scarce. At times some resources can become overutilised and become even more limited. For example, some species of fish have become quite rare because of overfishing.

## Key Factors affecting Consumer and Financial Decisions
- All consumers have individual needs and wants. Therefore, what people buy varies from one person to another. 

### Customer Service
- Good pre-sales and after-sales service makes you feel like a valued customer. Consequently, you will keey buying products from that store. Poor service can have the opposite effect.

### Price
 - If the **price** of a good is more than you can afford, you will probably not buy it. Consumers want the best value for their money: that is, they want to pay the lowest price for the best quality. 
 - To ensure this, the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* implemented a per unit pricing code for many products. 
 - This makes it very easy for consumers to compare the prices of products even if they are in different containers.

### Convenience
- Many consumers do not have a long time to shop. They want shopping to be hassle-free, or convenient. 
- Convenience has many meanings for consumers, such as travelling time to a retail outlet, the number of stores located within one shopping complex or suitable shopping hours. 
- Nowadays, convenience also relates to being able to shop online or havingg access to an app.

### Marketing and Advertising
- **Advertising** plays an essential role in influencing our consumer decisions.
- If the marketing campaign is successful, consumers will be influenced into thinking they need this product.

### Gender
- *Males* and *females* have a number of common wants, such as entertainment, music and a car, however a person's gender influences some types of purchases.

### Age
- Age also influences a consumers needs and wants. 

### Disposable Income
- A consumer's level of income determines what kind of product they regularly purchase.

> **Disposable income** refers to the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after income taxes have been accounted for.

### Environmental Considerations
- With increasing community awareness of environmental pollution, many consumers are becoming more aware of the problems caused by throwaway packaging. You therefore may be influenced to purchase a product that has minimal packaging or packaging that can be recycled.

### Social Media
- Social media includes websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking. 
- **Social influencers** are people with a large audience who post regularly on social media promoting products. The content they produce often influences their followers' purchasing decisions.

### Cultural Factors
> **Cultural factors** are the sets of basic values, perceptions and behaviours of a particular community or group of individuals. The culture of an individual influences the way they behave.

## How Individuals Make Particular Decisions
- The most basic financial decision consumers have to make is how much of their **income** to save and how much to spend. Income is money received  on a regular basis from work, property, business, investment or welfare.
- Consumers need to develop *financial plans* so that they will have enough money to take care of their needs and satisfy thier wants. 
- These plans are called **budgets**
- Most goods and services are available from more than one **retailer** or **e-tailer**. Often the same product costs different amounts at different stores or sites.

> **Comparison shopping** is the process of shopping around between several different retailers to obtain the best deal.

- If you know the cheapest price in the marketplace, you are in a better position to bargain. 
- If the prices are almost identical in all stores or sites, the most conveniently located retailer is often the smartest choice.
- If there is a lot of difference between the prices, the cheapest product may not always be the best buy because it may be of *inferior quality*, and consequently not last as long as more expensive items.
- Online shopping, or **e-commerce** has made comparison shopping much easier, as you can quickly compare prices for a wide variety of products from online stores around the world.
- However, you should always avoid the temptation of **impulse-buying**.

> **Impulse buying** is the purchasing of products without planning to do so in advance, as a result of a sudden whim or impulse.

## Choosing Where To Buy
- Once **manafacturers** have produced products, they are then usualy distributed to **wholesalers**. The wholesaler buys large quantities, then sells smaller quantities to retailers. 
- Wholesalers add their costs and a **profit** to the price they charge their retialer.
- Retailers also add their costs and a profit to the price they charge the consumer to arrive at the **recommended retail price**.

> **Mail order** is a system of shopping in which the consumer completes and posts an order form, usually from a magazine or catalogue, and receives the product through the mail.

- The advantages of **mail order** shopping include:
	- *a greater range of products available than found in retail stores.*
	- *the convenience for consumers with a disability or those that live in remote communities.*
- However, there are a number of disadvantages with this type of purchasing including the risk of:
	- *losing money if a business does not send the product*.
	- *products being different in reality from the way they appear in the catalogue*.
	- *experiencing problems tracing a business that uses only a post office box number if a refund is required.*
- The main advantages of **online shopping** are:
	- *an increase in the range of sources from which you can buy*.
	- *comparison shopping can be done from the comfort of your home and at a convenient time.*
	- *the product may be cheaper*
	- *it allows for quick price comparisons*
	- *relativley quick delivery times even from overseas sites.*
	- *allows for the use of mobile devices and apps which make online shopping even easier*.
- However, there are a number of disadvantages to *online shopping*:
	- *a website may not be permanent and tracing the owner if anything goes wrong may be difficult.*
	- *a delivery charge may be added to the price*.
	- *the return of a faulty product may take time and effort*.
	- *supplying credit card details can be risky unless the site is secure.*
	- *the proliferation of scams and internet fraud.* 
- Types of **retail stores** include:
	- **convenience / corner stores** are stores located in residential areas but are now commonly attached to service stations. They sell a variety of products, conecntrating on food items, magazines and newspapers. Prices at these stores are usually higher than at supermarkets and there is generally less choice available. However, they are convenient.
	- **specialty stores** specialise in one type of product or service or a limited range of a few products. Some specialty stores are part of a large franchise chain such as Dymocks and The Body Shop.
	- **discount variety stores** are stores that offer basic customer service and plain design. Their products are often cheaper than those of department stores. Examples include *Kmart* and *Target*.
	- **factory outlets** are often near the factory where the goods are manafactured. The goods are normally sold to the public at a discount because the costs of transportation and wholesalers are not involved in the distribution chain.
	- **department stores** are stores that sell a wide range of products within one store. Because they buy in bulk, their prices are often cheaper than those at specialty stores. However, because they offer some sales assistance on the shop floor, their prices tend to be higher than those at a discount variety store.
	- **supermarkets** are large, self-serve stores which sell a wide variety of products. Originally selling only food items, they are now becoming more like discount variety stores.
- A consumer can decide where they will shop. They can decide to shop:
	- *__locally__*
	- *__regionally__*
	- *__interstate or globally__*
