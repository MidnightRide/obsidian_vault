# Consumer and Financial Decisions
## The Nature of Commerce
> A **consumer** is someone who purchases *goods* and *services* to satisfy their *needs* and *wants*. 

- **Goods** are things that are produced and can be physically touched; for example, a television or a car.
- **Services** are things that one person will do for someone in return for payment.
- A *consumer* has the choice of purchasing either **durable** or **non-durable** goods. A durable good is one that can be used many times, such as a car or a television. **Non-durable** goods are those that can be used only once, such as food or petrol.
- What an *individual* gives up in order to satisfy a need or a want is known as an **opportunity cost**. 
- To satisfy our *needs* and *wants*, producers use **resources** to manafacture the goods and services that we desire. The four types of resources are:
	- *land - these resources occur naturally, such as forests, coal and fertile soil.*
	- *labour - this includes both the phsycal and mental effort of people who are working.*
	- *capital - these resources are goods used to make other goods. For example, a tractor is a capital good because it is used to produce crops.*
	- *enterprise - this is the ability to combine the other resources of land, labour and capital so as to earn a profit*.
- These *resources* are limited or scarce. At times some resources can become overutilised and become even more limited. For example, some species of fish have become quite rare because of overfishing.

## Key Factors affecting Consumer and Financial Decisions
- All consumers have individual needs and wants. Therefore, what people buy varies from one person to another. 

### Customer Service
- Good pre-sales and after-sales service makes you feel like a valued customer. Consequently, you will keey buying products from that store. Poor service can have the opposite effect.

### Price
 - If the **price** of a good is more than you can afford, you will probably not buy it. Consumers want the best value for their money: that is, they want to pay the lowest price for the best quality. 
 - To ensure this, the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* implemented a per unit pricing code for many products. 
 - This makes it very easy for consumers to compare the prices of products even if they are in different containers.

### Convenience
- Many consumers do not have a long time to shop. They want shopping to be hassle-free, or convenient. 
- Convenience has many meanings for consumers, such as travelling time to a retail outlet, the number of stores located within one shopping complex or suitable shopping hours. 
- Nowadays, convenience also relates to being able to shop online or havingg access to an app.

### Marketing and Advertising
- **Advertising** plays an essential role in influencing our consumer decisions.
- If the marketing campaign is successful, consumers will be influenced into thinking they need this product.

### Gender
- *Males* and *females* have a number of common wants, such as entertainment, music and a car, however a person's gender influences some types of purchases.

### Age
- Age also influences a consumers needs and wants. 

### Disposable Income
- A consumer's level of income determines what kind of product they regularly purchase.

> **Disposable income** refers to the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after income taxes have been accounted for.

### Environmental Considerations
- With increasing community awareness of environmental pollution, many consumers are becoming more aware of the problems caused by throwaway packaging. You therefore may be influenced to purchase a product that has minimal packaging or packaging that can be recycled.

### Social Media
- Social media includes websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking. 
- **Social influencers** are people with a large audience who post regularly on social media promoting products. The content they produce often influences their followers' purchasing decisions.

### Cultural Factors
> **Cultural factors** are the sets of basic values, perceptions and behaviours of a particular community or group of individuals. The culture of an individual influences the way they behave.

## How Individuals Make Particular Decisions
- The most basic financial decision consumers have to make is how much of their **income** to save and how much to spend. Income is money received  on a regular basis from work, property, business, investment or welfare.
- Consumers need to develop *financial plans* so that they will have enough money to take care of their needs and satisfy thier wants. 
- These plans are called **budgets**
- Most goods and services are available from more than one **retailer** or **e-tailer**. Often the same product costs different amounts at different stores or sites.

> **Comparison shopping** is the process of shopping around between several different retailers to obtain the best deal.

- If you know the cheapest price in the marketplace, you are in a better position to bargain. 
- If the prices are almost identical in all stores or sites, the most conveniently located retailer is often the smartest choice.
- If there is a lot of difference between the prices, the cheapest product may not always be the best buy because it may be of *inferior quality*, and consequently not last as long as more expensive items.
- Online shopping, or **e-commerce** has made comparison shopping much easier, as you can quickly compare prices for a wide variety of products from online stores around the world.
- However, you should always avoid the temptation of **impulse-buying**.

> **Impulse buying** is the purchasing of products without planning to do so in advance, as a result of a sudden whim or impulse.

## Choosing Where To Buy
- Once **manafacturers** have produced products, they are then usualy distributed to **wholesalers**. The wholesaler buys large quantities, then sells smaller quantities to retailers. 
- Wholesalers add their costs and a **profit** to the price they charge their retialer.
- Retailers also add their costs and a profit to the price they charge the consumer to arrive at the **recommended retail price**.

> **Mail order** is a system of shopping in which the consumer completes and posts an order form, usually from a magazine or catalogue, and receives the product through the mail.

- The advantages of **mail order** shopping include:
	- *a greater range of products available than found in retail stores.*
	- *the convenience for consumers with a disability or those that live in remote communities.*
- However, there are a number of disadvantages with this type of purchasing including the risk of:
	- *losing money if a business does not send the product*.
	- *products being different in reality from the way they appear in the catalogue*.
	- *experiencing problems tracing a business that uses only a post office box number if a refund is required.*
- The main advantages of **online shopping** are:
	- *an increase in the range of sources from which you can buy*.
	- *comparison shopping can be done from the comfort of your home and at a convenient time.*
	- *the product may be cheaper*
	- *it allows for quick price comparisons*
	- *relativley quick delivery times even from overseas sites.*
	- *allows for the use of mobile devices and apps which make online shopping even easier*.
- However, there are a number of disadvantages to *online shopping*:
	- *a website may not be permanent and tracing the owner if anything goes wrong may be difficult.*
	- *a delivery charge may be added to the price*.
	- *the return of a faulty product may take time and effort*.
	- *supplying credit card details can be risky unless the site is secure.*
	- *the proliferation of scams and internet fraud.* 
- Types of **retail stores** include:
	- **convenience / corner stores** are stores located in residential areas but are now commonly attached to service stations. They sell a variety of products, conecntrating on food items, magazines and newspapers. Prices at these stores are usually higher than at supermarkets and there is generally less choice available. However, they are convenient.
	- **specialty stores** specialise in one type of product or service or a limited range of a few products. Some specialty stores are part of a large franchise chain such as Dymocks and The Body Shop.
	- **discount variety stores** are stores that offer basic customer service and plain design. Their products are often cheaper than those of department stores. Examples include *Kmart* and *Target*.
	- **factory outlets** are often near the factory where the goods are manafactured. The goods are normally sold to the public at a discount because the costs of transportation and wholesalers are not involved in the distribution chain.
	- **department stores** are stores that sell a wide range of products within one store. Because they buy in bulk, their prices are often cheaper than those at specialty stores. However, because they offer some sales assistance on the shop floor, their prices tend to be higher than those at a discount variety store.
	- **supermarkets** are large, self-serve stores which sell a wide variety of products. Originally selling only food items, they are now becoming more like discount variety stores.
- A consumer can decide where they will shop. They can decide to shop:
	- *__locally__*
	- *__regionally__*
	- *__interstate or globally__*

## Different Payment Options
- There are several different types of payment options:
	- **cash** is the notes and coins issued by the federal government. Consumers usually use cash to pay for relatively inexpensive items, but rarely use it for expensive things like a car or a house.
		- *__advantages of cash include__*:

	- **credit** is the supply of money now in return for the promise of paying it back later. Credit allows you to buy what you want immediately and pay for it later, either in full or monthly payments. Because you are using money you do not have, you willb e charged *interest* for its use unless you pay the total balance back to the credit card company before the interest free period.

Then they enter transaction details, including a special customer reference number written on the bill, so money is transferred from their bank account directly to the business's account.

	- **afterpay** is a digital service linked to a customer's credit or debit card and enables consumers to 'buy now, pay later'. It allows consumers to purchase something at the current price and pay this amount off in four equal instalments every two weeks.

## Reasons for and features of a simple contract
> A **contract** is a legally enforcable agreement between two or more persons or parties.

- The contract outlines the details of the agreement and the *rights* and *responsibilities (obligations)* of each of the parties.
- A contract is most often an oral agreement. Agreements that invovle large sums of money, such as when buying a house, are usually put in writing.

## Features of a simple contract
- Three essential elements make a contract legally binding
	- The **offer** is a proposal. It involves one of the parties offering something of value. The *offeror* must clearly communicate their intention to the *offeree*.

	- An **acceptance** occurs when the *offeree* agrees to the proposal. This involves either a written or oral statement or an act that clearly communicates acceptance of the offer.

	- The **consideration** requires each party of the agreement to give up something of value. Consideration can take the form of a sum of money paid, or the promise to do something.

## Legal rights of customers
- Consumers have four basic rights, these are:
	- *Safe products*. Directions for proper use are provided and products are tested by the manafacturer to ensure product quality.
	
	- *Accurate product information and descriptions*. For example, ingredients are clearly labelled on food containers.
	- *Full disclosure of terms of sale*. The full price is always displayed, especially on any credit contracts.
	- *Consumer guarantees and warranties are honoured*. Customers can expect a refund or exchange if the product is faulty.

## Organisations that provide assistance for consumers
### State government
-  *New South Wales Fair Trading* is the state consumer protection agency. It provides information and assistance to all consumers on areas such as consumer issues, shopping on the internet, home building anad motor vehicle sales.

### Ombudsman
- Industry *ombudsman* have been established in the past years to deal with  disputes between consumers and specific businesses including finance, telecommunications and insurance.

### Federal government
- The two federal government commissions largely responsible for assisting consumers are:
	- *Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)*, which protects consumers in the areas of consumer credit, investment, life and general insurance, superannuation and banking. The aim of ASIC  is to assist in reduicing fraud in financial markets and financial products.
	- *The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)*. This commission  operates natoinally for the enforcement and administration of the Competition and Consumer Act, and acts as a watchdog on the pricing of goods and services.

## Processes of consumer redress
- Consumers can **redress** the things that are wrong if goods are different from how they were labelled, if they were faulty when manafactured or do not do what you were told they would do. The steps follow:
	- *Contact the trader by either phone or in person*. If you are using the phone, always get the name of the person you are talking to. Keep a written record of all conversations and copies of letters and emails. File any receipts, and return the faulty good immediately. If you leave the good with a trader,  request a receipt. Check your guarantee to determine whether it covers the problem being experiened.
	- *Contact your local NSW Fair Trading office and seek advice* if you have tried to redress the problem and still not satisfied. This will be an informal conversation where you explain the circumstances of your problem. The officer will ask you to provide certain information and copies  of any relevant documents.
	- *Lodge a claim with the NSW Civil and Adminstrative Tribunal (NCAT)* if you are still not satisified the problem has been redressed. It hears claims of value up to $40 000.

## Importance of long term financial strategies
- The most common strategy is to fund a comfortable retirement.
- While people can adopt many investment strategies to achieve this goal, such as investing in real estate, shares and managed funds, the most common is **superannuation**.

> **Superannuation**, or commonly called just *super*, is money that's put aside and saved while you're working.

- A superannuation fund is a compulsory savings account where each time you are paid, your employer will allocate a percentage of your income to the account.
- You should choose your own superannuation fund and not just accept the one the employer uses. Your decision should be based on the fund's fees and history of returns.

## Tools and strategies for effective financial management
> **Fixed expenses** are expenses that are the same amount every time.

- Other expenses are **variable** and change over time.
