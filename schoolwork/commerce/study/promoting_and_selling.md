# Promoting and Selling
## How businesses differentiate products
- Making products that stand out in the market
- Knowing your market
- Identifiying opportunities to differentiate products and jumping on them ASAP.
- Using the tactic of taking a photo of a product shown to be a lot worse than it really is and then comparing it to a photo at its best when it truly isn't that good. *(deceptive advertising)*

## Targeting 
- Companies target consumers through building brand loyalty and awareness, the internet and social media, pester power *(kids nagging their parents to buy them something)*, psychology and research and buzz marketing.
- **Market segmentation** refers to a market being subdivided into groups that can be categorised to a certain liking based on factors such as age, gender, income level, educational background etc.
- **Target market** refers to the group of customers to which a company wants to sell their product.

## Misleading advertising
- **The Competition and Consumer Act** ensures that all businesses operate and sell in a fair market, while also ensuring that businesses treat customers fairly.
