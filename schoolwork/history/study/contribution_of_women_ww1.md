# Explain the contribution of Australian women to the war effort during the First World War
## Brainstorm
## Research
### Volunteering in Australia
- In **World War I**, many Australian women on the *home front (the civilian population and activities of a nation whose armed forces are engaged in war abroad)* took on voluntary comfort and fundraising roles to support the troops overseas.
- There were several **women's organisations** that were active during the war, including:
	- Australian Women's National League
	- Australian Red Cross
	- Country Women's Association
	- Voluntary Aid Detachment
	- Australian Women's Service Corps
	- Women's Christian Temperance Union
-  Melbourne woman, **Vera Deakin** set up the *Red Cross Missing and Wounded Enquiry Bureau*. The organisation tried to get information to the families of soldiers who had either:
	-  **been killed**
	-  **were listed as missing**
	-  **were wounded**
	-  **had been taken prisoner**

### Creating Change
- Disharmony often developed when women on the *home front* took on roles that involved:
	- *patriotism*
	- *propaganda*
	- *politics*	
-  These types of activities could divide a community or groups within it.

#### Pro-war activism and patriotism
- Some women believed patriotism required them to urge men to enlist. 
- Other women had no desire to force men into service reacted badly to these campaigns.

#### Anti-war activism and pacifism
- Some women's organisations campaigned against the war and *conscription*. For example, the **Women's Peace Army** was formed in 1915 by two Melbourne women, **Vida Goldstein** and **Cecilia	John**.

### Women Oversees
- Women have played significant roles as *nurses in wartime*. In the South African War and World War I, the main service roles open to women were:
	- *nurses*
	- *medical support roles*, such as blood transfusionists and masseuses *(medical therapists)*.
	- *voluntary aid detachments (VADs)* carrrying out menial but essential tasks, like scrubbing floors.
- Civilian nurses and teachers often paid their own way to help overseas, during both the *South African War* and *World War I*.
- Red Cross nurses, known as **Bluebirds** due to their uniforms, served in hospitals on the front line in France.
- Canteens were set up for Australian troops in Egypt by Australian women. Among those who volunteered were:
	- *Alice Chisholm*
	- *Rania MacPhillamy*

### Military Service and Nursing
- World War I records show that:
	- *2139* women served in the *Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS)*
	- *130* women worked in the *Queen Alexandra Imperial Military Nursing Service* i the British army.
	- *423* women served in hospitals in Australia.
-  Nurses in the **AANS** were expected to be single or widowed. Although, some married women got through the recruiting check.
-  If a nurse married during her period of service, she was no longer allowed to serve in the **AIF _(Australian Imperial Force)_**.
-  Of those **AANS** nurses who served overseas for whom details are available:
	-  *7* were aged under 21
	-  *1184* were aged 21 to 30
	-  *947* were aged 31 to 40
	-  *91* were older than 40
- Some nurses paid their own way to be involved in medical service during the war. Some served in *non-profit organisations*, such as the **British Red Cross Society**.
- While working in the *casualty* in the *casualty clearing stations* in France, 7 nurses from the **AANS** were awarded the *Military Medal* for bravery and service under fire:
