### Volunteering in Australia
- In **World War I**, many Australian women on the *home front (the civilian population and activities of a nation whose armed forces are engaged in war abroad)* took on voluntary comfort and fundraising roles to support the troops overseas.
- There were several **women's organisations** that were active during the war, including:
	- Australian Women's National League
	- Australian Red Cross
	- Country Women's Association
	- Voluntary Aid Detachment
	- Australian Women's Service Corps
	- Women's Christian Temperance Union
-  Melbourne woman, **Vera Deakin** set up the *Red Cross Missing and Wounded Enquiry Bureau*. The organisation tried to get information to the families of soldiers who had either:
	-  **been killed**
	-  **were listed as missing**
	-  **were wounded**
	-  **had been taken prisoner**

### Creating Change
- Disharmony often developed when women on the *home front* took on roles that involved:
	- *patriotism*
	- *propaganda*
	- *politics*	
-  These types of activities could divide a community or groups within it.

#### Pro-war activism and patriotism
- Some women believed patriotism required them to urge men to enlist. 
- Other women had no desire to force men into service reacted badly to these campaigns.

#### Anti-war activism and pacifism
- Some women's organisations campaigned against the war and *conscription*. For example, the **Women's Peace Army** was formed in 1915 by two Melbourne women, **Vida Goldstein** and **Cecilia	John**.

### Women Oversees
- Women have played significant roles as *nurses in wartime*. In the South African War and World War I, the main service roles open to women were:
	- *nurses*
	- *medical support roles*, such as blood transfusionists and masseuses *(medical therapists)*.
	- *voluntary aid detachments (VADs)* carrrying out menial but essential tasks, like scrubbing floors.
- Civilian nurses and teachers often paid their own way to help overseas, during both the *South African War* and *World War I*.
- Red Cross nurses, known as **Bluebirds** due to their uniforms, served in hospitals on the front line in France.
- Canteens were set up for Australian troops in Egypt by Australian women. Among those who volunteered were:
	- *Alice Chisholm*
	- *Rania MacPhillamy*

### Military Service and Nursing
- World War I records show that:
	- *2139* women served in the *Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS)*
	- *130* women worked in the *Queen Alexandra Imperial Military Nursing Service* i the British army.
	- *423* women served in hospitals in Australia.
-  Nurses in the **AANS** were expected to be single or widowed. Although, some married women got through the recruiting check.
-  If a nurse married during her period of service, she was no longer allowed to serve in the **AIF _(Australian Imperial Force)_**.
-  Of those **AANS** nurses who served overseas for whom details are available:
	-  *7* were aged under 21
	-  *1184* were aged 21 to 30
	-  *947* were aged 31 to 40
	-  *91* were older than 40
- Some nurses paid their own way to be involved in medical service during the war. Some served in *non-profit organisations*, such as the **British Red Cross Society**.
- While working in the *casualty* in the *casualty clearing stations* in France, 7 nurses from the **AANS** were awarded the *Military Medal* for bravery and service under fire:
	- *Sister Dorothy Cawood*
	- *Sister Clara Deacon*
	- *Staff Nurse Mary Jane Derrer*
	- *Staff Nurse Alice Ross-King*
	- *Sister in Charge Alicia Kelly*
	- *Staff Nurse Rachael Pratt*
	- *Sister Pearl Corkhill*
- Of all the women who served in the **AANS** during the war, 23 died from illness or wounds. There area also records of one Australian women who spent time as *prisoner of war*.

> **Ethel Gillingham** was a trained nurse from western Victoria. In England at the outbreak of war, Gillingham joined the *British Red Cross Society*. In April 1915, Gillingham went with her unit to a hospital in *Vrnjatchka Banja, Serbia*. 
> 
> When the town fell to Austrian troops on *10 November 1915*, she was captured. Along with the rest of her unit, Gillingham was released unharmed. She safely reached Belgrade in *February 1916*.

### Impact of Wartime Employment
- The total Australian female workforce was:
	- *368457* before the war, or about 17% of the female population.
	- *436567* after the war, or about 16% of the female population.
- Women in Australia had been able to vote in federal elections and to stand for the federal Parliament since 1902, and vote in state elections since 1911, however their increased participation in the workforce during the war didn't open up new occupations.
- Those who took on paid work for the first time were mostly employed in *traditionally female occupied roles*.
- Fewer women worked in managerial and primary industry roles in *1921* compared to *1911*, but other categories of employment remained unchanged. The five main areas of employment for women in *1921* were:
	-  *personal, domestic and service workers*
	-  *craftsmen and foremen*
	-  *lower professional*
	-  *shop assistants*
	-  *clerical and related workers*
