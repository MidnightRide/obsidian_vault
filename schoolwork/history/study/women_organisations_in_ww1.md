# Women Organisations In WW1
## Australian Women's National League
> The **Australian Women's National League _(AWNL)_** was a conservative women's organisation established in 1904 to support the *monarchy and empire*, to *combat socialism*, *educate women in politics* and safegaurd the interests of the home, women and children.

- At its peak in World War I, the **AWNL** had 500 registered branches and more than 54, 000 members across Australia. Using it's massive membership base as a platform for achieving its objectives, it was very active in electoral politics and played a key role in supporting male candidates, forming an important part of conservative political efforts across Australia. 

## Australian Red Cross
- **The International Comitee of the Red Cross** was formed in 1862, its purpose being to find ways to overcome the *inadequacy* of army medical services so as to alleviate the suffering of those wounded in armed conflict.
