## Poetic Techniques
- There are several different types of poetic techniques which should be focused on:
	- _**Stanza** is a dividing and organizing technique which places groups of lines in a poem together. Stanza provides a strong structure and can help create distinct moods within a poem. It also helps the poem be more concise._ 
	- _**Alliteration** a poetic device where two or more words in a phrase or line of poetry share the same beginning consonant sound. Alliteration helps focus a readers attention on a particular section of text. Alliterative soudns create rhythm and mood and can have particular connotations, like alliteration of 's' to imply **snake-like quality**._
	- _**Rhyme** is a poetic technique in which the repitition of the same or similar sounds occurs in two or more words, usually at the end of lines in poems or songs. Rhyme can give impact to the images the poet is trying to create in the poem and can help create **internal rhythm** to depict meaning, emotion or feeling._
	- _**Personification** is a poetic device where animals, plants or even inanimate objects are given **human qualities**, resulting in a poem full of imagery and description. Personification helps connect readers with the object that is personified. Personification can make descriptions of non-human entities appear more vivid._
	- _**Simile** is a poetic device where the subject is described by comparing it to another object, using 'as' or 'like'. A simile can create vivid imagery in the readers mind, helping to engage and absorb them._
	- __**Metaphor** "", replace like with is_
	- **Poet**
	- _**Imagery** helps create similar snapshots in the reader's mind._
	- __**Synedoche**
	- **Juxtaposition**
	- **Tone, mood, voice**
	- **Allusions**
	- **Enjambment**
	- **Sibilance**
