# Poetry and Romanticism
## Poetic Techniques
- There are several different types of poetic techniques which should be focused on:
	- _**Stanza** is a dividing and organizing technique which places groups of lines in a poem together. Stanza provides a strong structure and can help create distinct moods within a poem. It also helps the poem be more concise._ 
	- _**Alliteration** a poetic device where two or more words in a phrase or line of poetry share the same beginning consonant sound. Alliteration helps focus a readers attention on a particular section of text. Alliterative soudns create rhythm and mood and can have particular connotations, like alliteration of 's' to imply **snake-like quality**._
	- _**Rhyme** is a poetic technique in which the repitition of the same or similar sounds occurs in two or more words, usually at the end of lines in poems or songs. Rhyme can give impact to the images the poet is trying to create in the poem and can help create **internal rhythm** to depict meaning, emotion or feeling._
	- _**Personification** is a poetic device where animals, plants or even inanimate objects are given **human qualities**, resulting in a poem full of imagery and description. Personification helps connect readers with the object that is personified. Personification can make descriptions of non-human entities appear more vivid._
	- _**Simile** is a poetic device where the subject is described by comparing it to another object, using 'as' or 'like'. A simile can create vivid imagery in the readers mind, helping to engage and absorb them._
	- _**Metaphor** "", replace like with is_
	- **Poet**
	- _**Imagery** helps create similar snapshots in the reader's mind._
	- _**Synedoche** is a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to signify the whole, or vice-versa. As a literary device, synecdoche allows for a smaller component of something to stand in for the large whole, allowing for variation in expression and helps engage the reader._
	- _**Juxtaposition** is a literary device that implies comparison or contrast. Writers create juxtaposition by placing two entities side by side to create dramatic or ironic contrast. This allows the reader to discern how the paired entities are similar or different. The effect of this literary device is a more profound understanding of contrast and creating a sense of fate or inevitability in the comparison._
	- _**Tone, mood, voice** is a literary device that reflects the writer's attitude towards the subject matter or audienc eof literary work. By conveying this attitude through tone, the write creates a particular relationship with the reader, that, in turn, influences the intention and meaning of the written words._
	- _**Allusions** are a brief reference to a person, place, thing or event or other literary work with twhich the reader is presumably familiar. Allusion allows the writer to compress a gread deal of meaning and significance into a singular phrase._
	- _**Enjambment** is a poetic term for the continuation of a sentence or phrase from one line of poetry to the next. Enjambent helps encourage the reader to continue reading from one line to the next, and creates a gripping flow._
	- _**Sibilance** is a poetic device where consonant sounds like "s" and "th" are stressed. It encourages readers to pay more attention, slowing down the reading process and strengthening reading comprehension._

> **Sublime** lofty, grand or exalted in thought, expression or manner. Of outstanding spiritual, intellectual or moral worth. Tending to inspire awe.
