# Protein Synthesis
## The Genetic Code
--- 
> **Proteins** are polymers made up  of **polypeptides** (chains of amino acids).

 - Proteins make up *major structures*, *organelles*, and *specific enzymes*. 
 - **DNA** proides specific instructions to assemble amino acids using the bases.
 - Amino acids are coded for by a triplet of bases, called a **codon**.
 - The codons for the amino acids are listed using **RNA**:
 
 > **RNA** is a single stranded chain formed by a process called transcription. It is a copy of a segment of DNA, where thymine *(T)** is replaced with uracil *(U)*.
 - There are specific codons which start and end the amino acid chain.
 
 The **genetic code** is a:
 - **triplet code** (a series of three bases are used to code).
 - **degenerate** (amino acids can be coded for by more than one codon).
 - **non-overlapping** (a codon will only code for ONE amino acid).
 - **universal** (the structure and components of DNA are the same in all living organisms).

## Protein Synthesis
--- 
There are two processes involved in **protein synthesis**:
- **transcription** the relevant gene in DNA is copied into a molecule of RNA called *mRNA* (messenger RNA) by the enzyme **RNA polymerase**. The steps of transcription are as follows:
	- The DNA double helix unzips as hydrogens bonds between the complementary bases break and the two strands seperate.
	- One strand acts as the template and the RNA nucleotides complement the base pairs	of the strand by forming hydrogen bonds.
	- The mRNA detaches from the DNA strand.
	- The two DNA strands join together and wind back up into a helix.
	> **NOTE** Not all bases in the DNA code for amino acids so the mRNA that is transcribed also contains non-coding regions called **introns**. The introns are removed by enzymes in a process called *splicing*, before the mRNA leaves the nucleus. This leaves just **exons** *(coding regions of mRNA)*.
	- After the intorns are removed, the mRNA moves out through a nuclear pore and attaches to a ribosome.
- **translation** refers to the proteins begin created using the template mRNA. The process of translation is as follows:
	- In the ribosome, the tRNA (transfer RNA) match the bases with those on mRNA and carries specific amino acids to the strand.
	- The tRNA then leaves to pick up another specific amino acid and ribosomes move along the mRNA by one codon.
	- This process repeats until the ribosome reads a 'stop' codon.

> **NOTE** The result of this process is a polypeptide chain. If the:
>  - expressed protein has only required one polypeptide chain then it will be called a **protein**.
>  - protein to be expressed requires more than one polypeptide, then the polypeptide chain formed will interact and bond with other polypeptides which together **fold or coil together** to form the protein.
