# Chemical and Physical Changes
## Chemical Changes
> **Chemical changes** take place by observing changes of temperature, appearace of new substances, or the disappearance of an original substance.

- **Chemical changes** involve substances reacting to form new substances.
- There are several examples of change:
	- *photosynthesis*
	- *respiration*
	- *chemical weathering*
- Chemical changes are when *bonds are broken and new ones are formed*, the substance composition is changed.
- Types of reactions include:
	- *synthesis*
	- *precipitation*
	- *decomposition*
	- *acid / base reactions*
	- *combustion*
	- *acid / carbonate reactions*
- Indicators of chemical changes include:
	- *change in temperature*
	- *change in colour*
	- *noticeable odour (after  reaction has begun)*
	- *formation of a precipitate*
	- *formation of bubbles*

## Physical Changes
- **Physical changes** are a type of change in which the form of matter is altered however the substance is not transformed into another, *chemical composition remains the esame*.

## Particle Theory
- Particle theory consists of *four parts*:
	1. All matter is made up of tiny particles.
	2. The particles of matter are always moving.
	3. The particles have spaces between them.
	4. Adding heat to matter makes particles move faster.
- There are some physical changes which occur when the state of matter changes in a substance:

|                            | Solid                                | Liquid                               | Gas                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| *Arrangement of particles* | Close together, regular pattern      | Close together, random arrangement.  | Far apart, random arrangement.       |
| *Movement of particles*    | Vibrate on the spot                  | Move around each other.              | Move quickly in all directions.      |

> A **monoatomic element** exists as one of itself in nature. It is *stable* and *inert*.

> A **diatomic element** exists combined with itself in nature. 

## Compounds
- **Compounds** can be broken down with a chemical reaction.
- There are two types of compounds relevant to us:
	- *binary compounds* involve two different types of atoms chemically bonded.
	- *ternary compounds* involve three different types of atoms chemically bonded.

## Law of Conservation of Mass
- The **law of conservation of mass** states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, only transformed.
- During any physical or chemical change, the total mass of the products remains equal to the total mass of the reactants.
- *Lavoisier* also provided evidence for:
	- the **law of constant proportions**, which states that a compound, no matter how it is formed, always contains the same relative amounts of
