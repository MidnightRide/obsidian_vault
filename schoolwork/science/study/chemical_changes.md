# Chemical and Physical Changes
## Chemical Changes
> **Chemical changes** take place by observing changes of temperature, appearace of new substances, or the disappearance of an original substance.

- **Chemical changes** involve substances reacting to form new substances.
- There are several examples of change:
	- *photosynthesis*
	- *respiration*
	- *chemical weathering*
- Chemical changes are when *bonds are broken and new ones are formed*, the substance composition is changed.
- Types of reactions include:
	- *synthesis*
	- *precipitation*
	- *decomposition*
	- *acid / base reactions*
	- *combustion*
	- *acid / carbonate reactions*
- Indicators of chemical changes include:
	- *change in temperature*
	- *change in colour*
	- *noticeable odour (after  reaction has begun)*
	- *formation of a precipitate*
	- *formation of bubbles*

## Physical Changes
- **Physical changes** are a type of change in which the form of matter is altered however the substance is not transformed into another, *chemical composition remains the esame*.

## Particle Theory
- Particle theory consists of *four parts*:
	1. All matter is made up of tiny particles.
	2. The particles of matter are always moving.
	3. The particles have spaces between them.
	4. Adding heat to matter makes particles move faster.
- There are some physical changes which occur when the state of matter changes in a substance:

|                            | Solid                                | Liquid                               | Gas                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| *Arrangement of particles* | Close together, regular pattern      | Close together, random arrangement.  | Far apart, random arrangement.       |
| *Movement of particles*    | Vibrate on the spot                  | Move around each other.              | Move quickly in all directions.      |

> A **monoatomic element** exists as one of itself in nature. It is *stable* and *inert*.

> A **diatomic element** exists combined with itself in nature. 

## Compounds
- **Compounds** can be broken down with a chemical reaction.
- There are two types of compounds relevant to us:
	- *binary compounds* involve two different types of atoms chemically bonded.
	- *ternary compounds* involve three different types of atoms chemically bonded.

## Law of Conservation of Mass
- The **law of conservation of mass** states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, only transformed.
- During any physical or chemical change, the total mass of the products remains equal to the total mass of the reactants.
- *Lavoisier* also provided evidence for:
	- the **law of constant proportions**, which states that a compound, no matter how it is formed, always contains the same relative amounts of each element.

## Types of Reactions
- **Synthesis / combination** reactions are a reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a single new substance.
- **Decomposition** reactions are a reaction in which a compound breaks  down into two or more simpler substances.
	- Types of decomposition reactions include:
		- *thermal decomposition*, where heat breaks down components into simpler substances.
		- *electrolysis*, where electrical energy decomposes reactions.
		- *photolysis*, decomposition of compounds via light energy.
- **Combustion reactions** are a reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen gas, releasing energy in the form of light and heat.
	- **Incomplete combustion** takes place in the presence of insufficient amount of oxygen. The flame type is *yellow* as opposed to *blue*, and the smoke is *sooty*. It also usually prodoces *CO* as a primary product as opposed to *CO<sub>2</sub>*.
- **Acid - base** reactions involve:
	-  *acid + reactive metal -> salt + hydrogen* dilute acids are added to *main-group metals* and some transition metals. Bubbles of hydrogen gas are released and salt is formed.
	- *acid + metal hydroxide -> salt + water* soluble metal hydroxides dissociate in water to form metal cations and hydroxide ions.
	- *acid + metal hydroxide -> ionic compound*
	- *acid + metal carbonate -> salt + water + CO<sub>2</sub>* 	

> **Naming salts** involves *positive ion (cation from base) + negative ion (anion from acid)*.

- **Neutralistion reactions**: *neutralised acid + base -> all hydroxide ions have reached with all hydrogen ions to form water + salt.*

> **NOTE** A neutralization reaction is **when an acid and a base react to form water and a salt** and involves the combination of H<sup>+</sup> ions and OH<sup>-</sup> ions to generate water. 

- **Precipitation reactions** occur when cations and anions in aqueous solutoin combine to form an insoluble solid called a preciptate.
	- An insoluble compound is formed when two clear solutions are mixed together.

>**NOTE** *To predict when a reaction will form a precipitate*, a solubility table can be used to determine whether common ionic compounds are soluble / insoluble in water:

> - sodium
> - nitrate
> - ammonium
> - acetate 
> - potassium

## Moles
- A **mole** is the base unit of amount of substance in the *International System of Units*. It is defined as exactly *6.022 x 10<sup>32<sup>* particles, which may be atoms, molecules, ions or electrons.
