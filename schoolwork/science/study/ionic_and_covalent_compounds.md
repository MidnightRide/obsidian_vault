# Ionic and Covalent Compunds
## Ionic Bonds
- If an atom takes one or more electrons from another atom, it becomes **charged**.
- When an atom *gains electrons*, it becomes negatively charged **anion**.
- When an atom *loses electrons*, it becomes positively charged **cation**.

## Ionic Compounds
- An **ionic compund** is a `metal + non-metal`. The ions are held together by ionic bonds.
- Ionic substances include:
	- **Salts** e.g. NaCl, CaCO<sub>3</sub>
	- **Bases** e.g metallic oxides, hydroxides.
	- **Acids diluted in water** e.g HCl<sub>(aq)</sub>

## Monatomic and Polyatomic Ions
- **Monoatomic ions** consist of one atom, e.g. Na<sup>+</sup>
- On the other hand, **polyatomic ions** consist of more than one atom, e.g. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.
- **Binary ionic compounds** are two ions combiend together, e.g. NaCl.

## Naming Ionic and Covalent Compounds
- The periodic table *tells us which atoms will form cations and anions*:

![[periodic_table_of_ions.png]]

- The net charge of an ionic compound **must equal zero**.
- When naming compounds, list the cation name *first* then the anion name.
- **Binary ionic compounds** end in 'ide', *e.g. KCl __potassium chloride__*

## Polyatomic Ions
- There are several common polyatomic ions that should be memorised:

- Polyatomic ionic compounds end in *'-ite' or '-ate'*. (Generally, ions with oxygen end in '-ate')
