# Ionic and Covalent Compunds
## Ionic and Covalent Bonds
- In an **ionic bond**, one atom 'steals' some electrons from the other.
- In a **covalent bond**, both atoms *share their electrons*.

## Ionic Bonds
- If an atom takes one or more electrons from another atom, it becomes **charged**.
- When an atom *gains electrons*, it becomes negatively charged **anion**.
- When an atom *loses electrons*, it becomes positively charged **cation**.

## Covalent Bonds
- When atoms *share* electrons, the shared electrons orbit the nuclei of both atoms. 
- Electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and the shared electrons *forms a nuclear bond*.
- As atoms become closer together, the positive nuclei repel each other, but are attracted by the opposing electrons, reaching a 'break-even' point.

## Covalent Molecules 
- Non-metals share electrons in the valence shell to form stable structures.
- They may share one or more electrons between identical or different atoms.

## Naming Covalent Compounds
- When naming compounds, list the cation name first, then the anion name.
	- Follow the template: *(prefix)* **first atom name** + *(prefix)* **second atom name**
- For **covalent compounds*, prefixes are used:

| Mono - 1 | Hexa - 6 |
| -| - |
| Di - 2 | Hepta -  7 |
| Tri - 3 | Octa - 8 |
| Tetra - 4 | Nona - 9 |
| Penta - 5 | Deca - 10 |

## Covalent Compound Properties
- **Covalent compounds** have several properties:
	- Relatively low melting and boiling points, **however** large covalent networks *(crystal lattices)* can cause the melting and boiling points to be very  high.
	- Brittle
	- Cannot conduct electricity in water or solid, gas and liquid states.
	- Many are insoluble in water.

## Ionic Compounds
- An **ionic compund** is a `metal + non-metal`. The ions are held together by ionic bonds.
- Ionic substances include:
	- **Salts** e.g. NaCl, CaCO<sub>3</sub>
	- **Bases** e.g metallic oxides, hydroxides.
	- **Acids diluted in water** e.g HCl<sub>(aq)</sub>

## Ionic Compound Properties
- **Ionic compounds** have several properties:
	- high melting and boiling points.
	- brittile.
	- soluble in water.
	- poor conductors of electricity when solid.
	- good conductors of electricity in a molten state.
	- good conductors of electricity when dissolved in solvents.

## Monatomic and Polyatomic Ions
- **Monoatomic ions** consist of one atom, e.g. Na<sup>+</sup>
- On the other hand, **polyatomic ions** consist of more than one atom, e.g. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.
- **Binary ionic compounds** are two ions combiend together, e.g. NaCl.

## Naming Ionic and Covalent Compounds
- The periodic table *tells us which atoms will form cations and anions*:

![[periodic_table_of_ions.png]]

- The net charge of an ionic compound **must equal zero**.
- When naming compounds, list the cation name *first* then the anion name.
- **Binary ionic compounds** end in 'ide', *e.g. KCl __potassium chloride__*

## Polyatomic Ions
- There are several common polyatomic ions that should be memorised:

- Polyatomic ionic compounds end in *'-ite' or '-ate'*. (Generally, ions with oxygen end in '-ate')
