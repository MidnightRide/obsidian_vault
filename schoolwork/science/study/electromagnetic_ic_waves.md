# Electromagnetic IC Waves
<sup>_**Students learn to** describe electromagnetic waves in terms of their speed in space and their lack of requirement of a medium for propogation._</sup>
## Electromagnetic Waves
- Electromagnetic waves have several different properties. They are:
	- *composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields*.
	- *require no medium to travel and thus can travel through a vacuum*.
	- *give out radiation of energy that are caused by the acceleleration of charged particles*.

> The **electromagnetic spectrum** is the full range of wavelengths of all electromagnetic waves.

- **Electromagnetic waves** have special properties that are outlined below:
	- *All electromagnetic energy passes through a vacuum of space at the speed of light (3 x 10<sup>8</sup>m s<sup>-1</sup>)*.
	- *The waves are produced by oscillating, perpendicular electric and magnetic fields*.
	- *The waves are considered to be __self propogating__, meaning the electric field produces a perpendicular magnetic field which in-turn induces an electric field, etc.*
	- *This property enables EM waves to travel distances of the universe, billions of light years away from the source of radiation*.
- In free space, **electromagnetic waves** travel with the same speed: 3.00 x 10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup>.
- They slow down when travelling in any physical medium apart from a vacuum.
