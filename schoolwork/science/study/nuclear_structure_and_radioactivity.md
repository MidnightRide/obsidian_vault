# Nuclear Structure and Radioactivity
## Representing Atomic Structure
- The **type of atom** that makes up each element is determined by **the number of protons** in the nucleus.
- The standard way of representing an atom of a particular element is with its atomic and mass numbers.

## Radioactivity
- Radioactivity refers to the spontaneous release of energy or energetic particles from unstable nuclei. These nuclei are *unstable as the __neutron-to-proton ratio is not ideal__*,
- In nature, there are three types of radioactivity *(radioactive decay)*:
	- __alpha *α*__ many heavy nuclei undergo alpha decay, resulting in the emission of a *helium-4* nucleus as an alpha particle. This is done to remove excess mass and energy.
	- __beta *β*__ decay involves two types:
		- Nuclei that contain **too many neutrons** often undergo beta<sup>-</sup> decay, in which a neutron is converted to a proton and an electron. 
			- The proton stays in the nucleus while the electron gets ejected.
			-  Beta decay decreases the neutron-to-proton ratio, moving the nucleus to the band of stable nuclei.
		- Nuclei that have **too few neutrons** can undergo positron emission (beta<sup>+</sup>) decay.
			- In positron emission, a *proton will turn into a neutron* and emit a positron. ![[positron_equation.png]] 
			
	> **NOTE** A positron is the antimatter version of an electron.
	
	- __gamma *γ*__ is the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation in the EMR spectrum. Gamma decay occurs when atoms *try to discharge excessive amounts of energy from the nucleus*. It may accompany alpha or beta decay or nuclear fission.

> **NOTE** α and β are particles while γ is electromagnetic radiation.
