# Natural Selection
## Charles Darwin
- **Charles Darwin** became convinced that living things had changed and can change over time. 
- He devoted the rest of his life to studying living things and developing a theory to explain  how the changes could occur.

## How Evolution Works
- The steps of evolution in Darwin's theory include:
	- All organisms produce **more offspring than could possibly survive**.
	- In every species there is **variation**. Each individual is slightly different.
	- **Nature selects which individuals survive**. Factors such as predators, diseases & climate determine which individuals survive to breed.
	- The survivors breed and **pass on to offspring the characteristics which helped them survive**.
	- This may mean that each succeeding generation is *slightly different* to the generation before. Gradually, over generations, changes accumulate as *natural selection* keeps choosing new survivors. Gradually, the population evolves into a new type, and eventually a new species.  

## Variation
- A **species** is a group of organisms that can *interbreed to produce* **fertile offspring**.
- Within a species, there are *differences between individuals* - **variations**.
- There are several different types of variations:
	- **structural** variations, e.g *the size of the individual's limbs*.
	- **biochemical** variations, e.g *blood group*.
	- **physiological** variations, e.g *the ability to smell different odours*.
	- **developmental** variations, e.g *changes that are age-related*
-  **Behavioural** adaptations lead to variations. These differences can be inherited and carried out by instinct.

## Isolation
- **Isolation** is important in the evolution of a new species. If some members of the group become isolated in some way so that they can no longer interbreed with the rest of the group, then a new species can develop. 
- *Changes in the environment* can help isolate groups.
- When two groups are seperated, variations and mutations lead to changes in each group. After a long while, the two groups become so different they can no longer interbreed as they may be inactive at different times of day, breed in different seasons. They are now **considered a different species**.

## Natural Selection
- Factors in the environment lead to the survival of some and not others. Those that have fabourable traits for that environment survive. This is **natural selection**.
- If the environment changes, then different features become favourable.

> **Speciation** is the process of forming a new species.
