# Natural Selection
## Charles Darwin
---
- **Charles Darwin** became convinced that living things had changed and can change over time. 
- He devoted the rest of his life to studying living things and developing a theory to explain  how the changes could occur.

## How Evolution Works
---
- The steps of evolution in Darwin's theory include:
	- All organisms produce **more offspring than could possibly survive**.
	- In every species there is **variation**. Each individual is slightly different.
	- **Nature selects which individuals survive**. Factors such as predators, diseases & climate determine which individuals survive to breed.
	- The survivors breed and **pass on to offspring the characteristics which helped them survive**.
	- This may mean that each succeeding generation is *slightly different* to the generation before. Gradually, over generations, changes accumulate as *natural selection* keeps choosing new survivors. Gradually, the population evolves into a new type, and eventually a new species.
