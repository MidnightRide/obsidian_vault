# Biodiversity
## Filling the Niches
> **Biodiversity** refers to the variety of different life.

- There are three levels of biodiversity:
	- **Genetic diversity** refers to the range of different genes in the group and the size of the gene pool.
	- **Species diversity** refers the the number of different species in an area.
	- **Ecosystem diversity** refers to the *variety of ecosystems* on Earth.

> A **niche** for a species is *the way it uses all the living and non-living things in it's environment.*

### Convergent Evolution and Biodiversity
- **Convergent evolution** occurs when organisms become superficially similar because they live in similar environments or have a similar habitat or lifestyle.
- **Analogous structures** are features that look similar but come from different ancestors.

### Divergent Evolution and Biodiversity
- **Divergent evolution** is the development of different species from a common ancestor. It occurs due to a process called **adaptive  radiation**.

> **Adaptive radiation** occurs when a single or small group of ancestral species rapidly diversifies into a large number of descendant species.
