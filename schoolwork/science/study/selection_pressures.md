# Selection Pressures 
## Natural Pressures
- Each environment puts selection pressures on each population. Over time, these pressures change and evolution occurs.
- Natural pressures can be classified as:
	- **Abiotic** (non-living) pressures - *physical agents e.g. pollutants in soil*
	- **Biotic** (living) pressures - *living things e.g. predators, food sources or pathogens*.

## Artificial Selection
- **Artificial selection** is when humans choose particular characteristics and breed domesticated populations for particular purposes, *e.g. breeding beef or cattle for their meat or wool.*

## Theories of Evolution
- Humans throughout history have been interested in the origin of different life forms:
	- **Jean-Baptiste Lamarck** was a French naturalist who believed in evolutionary change. He believed each animal tried to adapt to its environment and passed on these changes to their offspring. His theory had two parts:
		- *By use or disuse individuals can make some body parts stronger while others weaker.*
		- *Offspring inherit these characteristics*.
	- **Charles Darwin** put forward a mechanism for evolution. The main points of his theory were:
		- More organisms are born than can survive.
		- Within a population there is variation.
		- Those with favourable features survive by natural selection and therefore reproduce.
		- The offspring inherit the favourable features.
		- Over time the poplulation changes so that the favourable features become more common.
