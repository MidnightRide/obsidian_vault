# Sound Waves
## Properties of Sound Waves
- **Sound waves** can travel within *solids, liquids or gases*.
- In **sound waves**, the molecuels of any elastic medium vibrate parallel to the direction of wave travel.
- They collide with neighbouring molecules and so transfer the energy through the medium.

> **NOTE** Sound waves require a medium to travel, and therefore cannot travel through a vaccuum.

## Rarefractions and Compressions
- **Rarefractions** are the places where the pressure is the highest and the particles are closest together.
- **Compressions** are the places where the pressure is the lowest and the particles are furthest apart.

## The Principle of Superposition
- **Interference** when waves meet, they interact as they pass through each other, reinforcing or cancelling at different points.
- **Superposition** the adding of two or more waves.
- *Sound waves* from seperate sources interfere with each other and their amplitudes can be added.
- When this occurs, it is possible to produce a sound of higher or lower amplitude depending on whether the sound waves are in or out of phase.
- Changes in the wave trace above are due to the superposition of the different waves.
- This means that the displacements of the different waves at individual points in time have been added.
- If the displacements of the seperate waves are opposite *(a crest of one wave is added to the trough of another)* at the same time, then the resulting displacement will be lower.
- If the waves have two crests or two troughs coinciding at that point, then the amplitude of the wave will be bigger at the time the waves are added.

## Pitch and Frequency
- **Pitch** is *directly related* to the frequency of a sound.
- The higher the frequency of the sound, the more vibrations per second and the higher the pitch.
- A low-frequency sound is a low-pitched sound.
