# Total Internal Reflection
<sup>_**Students learn to** conduct investigations to examine qualitatively and quantitatively the refraction and total internal reflection of light._</sup>

## Refraction
- A ray of light entering from a *low refractive index* medium to a *high refractive index* medium;
	- *the light ray will bend away from the normal*.
	- *the farther the incident ray is form the normal, the farther the refracted ray will be from it as well*.

## Critical Angle
- A small change in the angle of incidence causes a bigger change in the angle of reefraction *(due to the refractive indexes of the materials)*.
- Thus, an **angle of incidence** where the ray	can't exit the optically denser material is possible.
- This is because it is refracted to such an extent that it is bent 90<sup>o</sup> from the normal.

> **Critical angle** is the angle where total internal reflection prevents the ray from escaping from a higher density medium to a lower density medium, therefore:

> `critical angle = angle of incidence that causes the angle of refraction to equal 90Â°`.

- **Total internal reflection** occurs when the critical angle of incidence of a ray for the two substances is exceeded.	
- This means that instead of a ray being refracted and exiting the optically denser material, the incident ray is reflected inside the material. 
- From that point, the ray will *obey the laws of reflection* off the surface between the two materials and is essentially trapped internally, as shown in the diagram below.
- The **conditions for total internal reflection** are:
	1. The incident ray *(light source)* is occurring in the denser medium *(higher refractive index)*.
	2. The **angle of incidence** is greater than the critical angle.

## Calculating the Critical Angle
- You can find the critical angle of refraction at a boundary between two mediums where the refracted ray cannot leave the first medium to enter the second medium using **Snell's law**.

<sup>_*1 and 2 subscripts = values for the first and second materials the light enters, i = angle of incidence and r = angle of refraction._
	
- At the  critical angle, the angle of refraction is 90<sup>o</sup>. Therefore you can substitute `r` for 90<sup>o</sup>.

<sup>_*Note that n<sub>2</sub> < n<sub>1</sub> for light to bend away from the normal._</sup>

## Dispersion
<sup>_**Students learn to** explain the phenomon of the dispersion of light_<sup>
	
> **Dispersion** occurs when white light is seperated into its different constituent colours due to refraction and Snell's law.
	
- White light only appears white because it is *composed of every colour on the visible spectrum*.
- **Dispersion** occurs whenever there is a process that changes the direction of light in a manner that depends on the wavelength.
- **Remember:**
	- *The angle of refraction depends on the index of refraction.*
	- *The index of refraction (n) depends on the medium.*
- **However**, for a given medium, *n* also depends on the wavelength.
