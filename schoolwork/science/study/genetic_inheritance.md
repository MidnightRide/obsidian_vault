# Genetic Inheritance
## Gregor Mendel
---
- Gregor Mendel was an Austrian monk who performed scientific experiments on *pea plants*. He grew these plants and recorded **the resulting ratios of characteristics that appeared in the offspring**.
- He was then able to reliably predict the probability of the characteristics in the offspring. Hence, he recognised a **pattern of inheritance of characteristics** by offspring from their parents and so he proposed a model of inheritance.
- From his results, Mendel's laws are as follows:
	- **Mendel's law of dominance and segregation:**
		- When gametes form, alleles are seperated so that each gamete carries only **one allele for each gene**.
		- **Recessive alleles** will be masked by **dominant alleles*.
	-	**Mendel's law of independent assortment:**
		-	The **segregation of alleles for one gene occurs independently** to that of any other gene. This law applies in all cases except when the genes are linked *(situated on the same chromosome)*.

## Genotype and Phenotypes
---
- The law of segregation does not completely explain why Mendel often found that one form of the characteristic he was examining would disappear from the offspring but reappear in subsequent generations during his  crosses.

> Different forms of the same gene are called **alleles**.

- An **individual** may have different combinations of those alleles. Therefore, individuals can be described based on their:
	- **genotype** specific combination of alleles. Represented by a *pair of letters*.
	- **phenotype** the internal or external characteristics of an organism *(e.g petal colour, blood type)*.
	
> **NOTE** When the alleles are:
> - **different** they are said to be *heterozygous*, as that characteristic and the individual carrying the genes is a hybrid.
> - the **same**, they are *homozygous* and the individual is pure bred for that characteristic.

> **NOTE** 
> - One allele may dominate over another.
> The **dominant allele** is *always expressed* and represented using an **uppercase letter**.
> The **recessive allele** is only expressed in the absence of a dominant and is expressed using a **lowercase letter**.

## Punnet Squares
---
- A **punnet square** can be used to work out all the *possible combinations of alleles* that can be present in the offspring of two parents who's genotypes are known. They also help deduce the **probabilities** of each one occurring.
- When working out a problem, it is helpful to:
	-  **Choose a letter to represent the gene**. It is useful to base the letter on the dominant phenotype.
	-  Represent the genotype of each parent witha  pair of letters.
	-  Combine pairs of the letters representing the gametes to give all the possible genotypes of the offspring.
	-  From the possible genotypes, work out the possible phenotypes of the offspring.

> **NOTE** For probabilities, use a **decimal value ranging from zero - one**, and for ratios, use a ratio.

## Monohybrid Crosses
---
> **Monohybrid crosses** involve just one gene with two alleles.

- From these crosses, we can figure out the *phenotypic and genotypic ratio and probabilities of the offspring for one gene*.

## Test Crosses
---
- A **test cross** is used to test an individual with a dominant phenotype to determine whether it is *heterozygous* or *homozygous*.

- When the unknown dominant phenotype is breeded with a known recessive genotype, the resulting offspring probabilities *indicate whether the unkown dominant phenotype is heterozygous or homozygous*, as a homozygous genotype would result in a 100% dominant phenotypic ratio in it's offspring. 

## Dihybrid Crosses
---
- A **dihybrid cross** determines the genotypic and phenotypic combinations of offspring for *two particular genes that are unlinked*.
- Because there are two genes, each with two alleles, there can be **up to four different gamete combinations**. 
- The easiest way to work out potential gamete combinations in a dihybrid cross is to use the **FOIL** method.

- You can then simply generate a 4 x 4 table and "add" the genotypes to produce the resulting probabilities.

## Other Types of Inheritance
--- 
- **Co-dominance** is where **two different alleles** for the same gene are present, and therefore *both alleles are expressed* as seperate, *unblended phenotypes*, and so they are termed **co-dominant**.
- Examples of co-dominance include:
	- *coat colour in cattle*.
	- *blood type in humans*.
- **Incomplete dominacne** occurs when neither allele is dominant, and a blend of the two phenotypes is produced.
