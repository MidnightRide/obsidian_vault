# Trends in the Periodic Table
## Atomic Radius
- **Decreases** from left to right within a period, and **increases** from top to  bottom.
## Electronegativity
- **Electronegativity** is the ability of an atom to *attract and bind electrons* to itself when it is combined with another atom.
- Electronegativity increasees from left to right across a period, as there is an **increase in the charge of the nucleus**.
- Electronegativity decreases from top to bottom, as there is an **increase** in electron shielding.
- However, there are **exceptions** to this rule:
	- **Noble gases** have full valence shells, and therefore have no need to attract other electrons.
	- The **lanthanides** and **actinides** posses more complicated chemistry and do not generally follow trends.
