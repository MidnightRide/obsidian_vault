# Electron Configuration
## Quantum Numbers
- **Electrons** are both *particles* and *waves*.
- The location and energy of every electron in an atom is determined by a set of **four quantum numbers** that describe different atomic orbitals.

> **NOTE** An orbital is a region of probability where an electron can be found. There are *s*, *p*, *d*, and *f* orbitals in different shapes. **Remember**, these shapes are not electrons but just regions of probability where an electron can be.

- The more electrons an atom has, the more orbitals it will need to accomodate them all.
- There are four distinct quantum numbers which describe an electron:
	- The *first quantum number* is the principle quantum number **n**, which can have any positive integer value. This number represents the energy level of the electron and can be seen in the Bohr model.
	- The next quantum number is the angular momentum quantum number **l**. This number can have any number from 0 to **n** - 1. The **l** value describes the shape of the orbital:
		-  When **l** is equal to zero, we are describing *s* orbitals. There is only one *s* orbital per energy level.  
		-  When **l** equals one, we are describing *p* orbitals, which are lobes that extend outwards on three axes. There are three p orbitals per energy level. 
		-  When **l** is equal to 2, we are describing *d* orbitals. There are five *d* orbitals per energy level. 
		-  When **l** is equal to 3, we are describing *f* orbitals, which have seven per energy level.
	- The third quantum number is the magnetic quantum number, **m<sub>l</sub>**. This can have a value anywhere from **-l** to **l**. 
		- This quantum number *determines how many orbitals there are of a type, per energy level*. 
		- Therefore, describes a specific orbital amongst a particular set, explaining why the orbitals have the frequency they do.
	- The last quantum number is the *sping quantum number*, **m<sub>s</sub>**. This value ranges from 0.5 to -0.5.
- No two electrons in an atom have the **same quantum numbers**, as stated by the *Pauli Exclusion Principle*. This is because any orbital can only hold up to two electrons, and two electrons in the same orbital must have different spin values, or **m<sub>s</sub>**.
- The **Aufbau Principle** tells us the order in which an atom will fill up it's electrons.

- The **Aufbau Principle** is termined by the orbital's relative energies.
