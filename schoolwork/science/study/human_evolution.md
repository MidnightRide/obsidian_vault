# Human Evolution
## The Primates
- The **primates** are an order of animals that are mammals, and like all mammals, have hair or fur and feed their young milk from their mammary glands.
- They are adapted to a tree-dwelling life in forests.
- Primates include the:
	- *lemur*
	- *indri*
	- *aye-aye*
	- *loris*
	- *brush-baby*
	- *tarsier*
	- *monkeys*
	- *capuchin*
	- *macaques*
	- *baboon*
	- *mandrill*
	- *gibbon*
	- *orangutan*
	- *chimpanzee*
	- *gorilla*
	- *human*
- **Humans** are different to other primates as people have a foot suited to bipedal locomotion and can maintain an upright stance.

## Hominin Evolution
> **Hominins** are primates that include modern humans, extinct human species and all of our immediate ancestors.
- The term **hominid** once had this meaning, however now *include not just only the human line but all of the great apes __(chimpanzees, gorillas and oranguatans)__ and their ancestors.*
- The physical changes in the evolution of humans are **genetic**. These changes were accompanied by **cultural evolution**. Cultural evolution refers to the behaviour or lifestyle passed by word of mouth, or written means from one generation to the next.
