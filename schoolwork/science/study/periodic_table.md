# The Periodic Table
## Periodicity
- The elements in the **periodic table** are arranged to show how the properties of the elements *repeat periodically.*
- This **periodicity** of the elements is reflected in their *physical __(e.g. state at room temperature)__* and *chemical __(e.g. reactivity with water)__* properties.
- The atomic and ionic radii, electronegativity, ionisation energy are *of particular interest* as they explain the periodicity of the chemical properties.

> **NOTE** The concept of **effective nuclear charge** is helpful in explaining trends in both chemical and physical properties.

## Effective Nuclear Charge
- The **effective nuclear charge** is the **net positive charge** experienced by an electron in a multi-electron atom. It depends on:
	- **The distance of the electrons from the nucleus** by *Coloumb's law*, as **distance from the nucleus increases**, the *force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus decreases*.
	- **Electron shielding** is the *reduced attractive force* experienced by the valence electrons and the positive nucleus. This is due to the repulsive force of inner electrons.

## Atomic Radius
- From the **Schrodinger model of the atom**, electrons occupy atomic orbitals, which give a probability of the electrons' locations. Hence, atoms **do not have sharp boundaries**.
- Atom radius is measured as **half the distance between two neighbouring nuclei**.	 It is measured in **picometres _(pm)_** where 1 pm is 1 x 10<sup>-32</sup>m.

> **NOTE** There are many ways in which  atomic radius can be measured, depending on the element.

- Atomic radius **decreases across a period** and **increases down a group**, as across a period electron shielding remains constant while the charge of the nucleus increases, applying a stronger force on the electrons, whereas down a group, electron shielding increases.
