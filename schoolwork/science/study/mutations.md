# Mutations
## Mutations
> A **mutation** is a *change in the genetic material of a cell* - a *change in the sequence of nucleotides of DNA.*
- A mutation of the genetic material is another way that *variation can arise*.
- Mutations may lead to the **generation of new alleles** in an organism.

> **NOTE** An **allele** is one or more alternative forms of a gene.
- Mutations may be:
	- **beneficial**, giving the organism an *adaptive advantage* in terms of *natural selection*.
	- **neutral** and *have no effect as the amino acid expressed is not changed and hence the protein formed remains unchanged*.
	- **harmful** and may *cause genetic disorders or cancer*.

## Gene and Chromsomal Mutations
### Gene Mutations
- **Gene mutations** are mutations that affect small regions of DNA, usually one base.
- Gene mutations are also known as *point mutations* as they occur at a single point in the DNA sequence.
- Point mutations include:
	- **deletions** where DNA is lost.
	- **substitutions** where a different base is included.
	- **insertions** where a base is added.

> **NOTE** Deletions and insertions are also caused **frameshift mutations** because they shift the frame of the genetic message, offsetting and changing the message of all following codons.

### Chromosomal Mutations
- **Chromosomal mutations** are mutations that affect large regions of DNA that is  contained within chromosomes. This may affect the entire chromosome.
- *Chromsomal mutations* include **deletion**, **duplication**, **Inversion** and **translocation**:
	- **deletion** a mutation causing part of the chromosome to be missing.
	- **duplication** a mutation causing part of the chromosome to be repeated, resulting in extra genetic material.
	- **inversion** a mutation due to a portion of a chromosome breaking and rejoining in the opposite orientation.
	- **translocation** a mutation causing one portion of a chromosome to be moved to a different part of the chromosome or to *another chromosome altogether*.

> **NOTE**
> - If whole chromosomes become rearranged, a *change in the number of chromosomes* may arise.
> - This usually occurs as a result of a chromosome *not seperating out correctly during meiosis __(non-disjunction)__*.
> - The resulting cells may have *one more or one less chromosome than normal*.
