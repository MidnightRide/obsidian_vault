# Factors for Survival
## Genetic Characteristics and Survival
- The **gene pool** is all the genes in a population at one time. There are alleles for each gene, *e.g. the gene for eye colour could have the allele for blue eyes and brown eyes*.

> **Directional selection** is the concept that *natural selection* favours the alleles for the favourable traits and over time the frequency of these alleles increases in the poplulation. 

- Changes in the **gene pool** lead to *evolution*. 
- Large popoulations have more stable gene pools than small ones.

> **Genetic drift** is the process of the changes in frequency of alleles due to random chance.

## Reproductive Rates and Survival
- Reproduction is *the aim of organisms*, and the **rate of reproduction** can greatly affect the ability of a population to survive changing conditions.

> **Reproductive strategy** refers to the way organisms ensure they have offspring which survive to produce offspring of their own.

-  Different species have different reproductive strategies. Some species may produce offspring with little parental care while others have fewer offspring which require more parental care.
-  Animals in stable environments often have fewer offspring at a lower rate compared to those in harsher conditions.
