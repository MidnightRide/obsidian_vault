# Waves
## What is a Wave?
> A **wave** is a periodic disturbance that transfers energy. It is a *disturbance that travels through a medium from one location to another*

- This phenomena is called **wave motion**.

> A **medium** is the material through which a wave travels.

- *Waves* are able to transfer energy between locations due to *wave motion*.
- A wave is a carrier of energy, not matter!

## The Wave Model
- **Crests** are the highest points of waves.
- **Troughs** are the lowest points of waves.
- **Amplitude** is the maximum size of the particle displacement from the undisturbed state.
- Two points on a wave are in **phase** if, at a particular instant, they have the same displacement and velocity.
- **Wavelength** is the distance between two corresponding points in a wave *(wavelength = λ)*.
- **Frequency** is the number of waves that pass a fixed point per second *(frequency = f)*. Frequency is usually measured in *cycles per second*, or *Hz*.  One hertz is one cycle or wavelength passing a point per second.
- **Period** is the time it takes a single wave to pass a fixed point *(period = t)*. The period and frequency are related through a reciprocal relationship:

- **Velocity** is the speed at which a wave propogates - how fast the wave transfers energy away from a source. If the *wavelength* and *frequency* are known, we can calculate the velocity wiht the formula `v = fλ`.

## Carriers of Energy
- The source of all waves is **vibration**. Through a *vibration*, energy is transferred from the origin to another place.
- There are sound, light and electromagnetic waves.
- Energy is carried by the wave away from a source of disturbance, such as a pebble thrown into a pond. 
- The material of the medium through which the wave passes is not carried along - it is energy, not matter, that is transferred from one place to another.

> **NOTE** There are several different types of waves.
> - *Mechanical waves* require a medium.
> - *Electromagnetic waves* do not require a medium*.

## Mechanical Waves
- **Mechanical waves** involve the transfer of energy through a medium by the motion of particles of the medium itself.
- The particles move as oscillations or vibrations around a fixed point.
- Types of mechanical waves include:
	- *transverse waves*, which cause the medium to move perpendicular to the direction of the wave.
	- *longitudinal waves*, which cause the medium to move parallel to the direction of the wave.

## Wavefronts
- A **wavefront** is the face of the wave as it propogates forwards.
- When energy is transferred in the direction the wave is travelling, it may occur in one, two or three **dimensions**.
- The energfy of the wave motion has only one dimension in which to travel.
- The wave transfers energy through the medium by the propogation of a disturbance.
- **Surface waves** are waves that propogates in two dimensions and has circular wavefronts, like a pebbe on the surface of a pond.
- **Spherical waves** are waves that propogate in three dimensions and have spherical wavefronts.
- The perpendicular distance between wavefronts is one *wavelength*.
