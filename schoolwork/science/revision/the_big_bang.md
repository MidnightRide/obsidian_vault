# The Big Bang
There are several eras proceeding the big bang:
- `The Planck Era` immediately after the event which began the universe, from *0 to approximately 10-43 seconds*.
- `The Grand Unified Theory (GUT) Era` three of the four fundamental forces are combined, however gravity is distinct. Lasted from *10<sup>-43</sup>s to 10^<sup>-38</sup>s*.
- `Electroweak Era` the period in the evolution of the early universe when the temperature of the universe had fallen enough that the strong force seperated from the electroweak interaction.
- `Era of Particles` when the four fundamental forces were finally dinstinct, particles could sart to form. However, both **matter** and **anti-matter** were formed in almost equal numbers, created out of the energetic photons present at that time. Quarks combined to form hadrons such as:
	-  **protons** and **antiprotons**.
	-  **neutrons** and **antineutrons**.
- `Era of Atoms` by the time that the universe reached 3000 K, it was **cool enough to allow for neutral atoms to form**.
	- At this stage, photons no longer were coupled with electrons, so most of the gas became transparent and the photons were free at last to stream out of the plasma and cross the  universe. These photons constitute the cosmic microwave background radiation.
